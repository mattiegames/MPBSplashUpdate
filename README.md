# MPBSplashUpdate


  Okay, I will try and make this as easy as I can.


  1:  Be sure to open and read Program.cs, you will see the code for the server side .XML there.
      -For more information on the updater goto: https://github.com/ravibpatel/AutoUpdater.NET

  2:  Your program version information is stored in /properties/AssemblyInfo.cs look for this.<br>
  [assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.0.0")]<br>
  [assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.0.0.0")]


  3: SplashScreen is easy.  /SplashScree, modify it however you see fit.



              Well that is it, hope this help some people.   Enjoy
